        <h2>History of Mahakaleshwar ujjain</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>The temple is mention in puranas, where it is stated that prajapati brahma built it, is proof that of it’s
            ancient existence. The temple is belived to be in the 6th century AD by Kumarasena, the son of a former king
            of Ujjain, Chandpradyot.
            It was further reconstructed in the 12th century AD under king Udayaditya and king Naravarman. Later, the
            Maratha commander Ranoji Shinde under Peshwa Bajirao-1 renovated this temple in the 18th century AD.
            The Mahakaleshwar Lingam is said to be the largest among all the 12 Jyotirlingas.
            The significance of the Mahakaleshwar Temple is that the Lingam of Mahakaleshwar is Swayambhu in nature. Sri
            Mahakaleshwar is the Lord of Time. He is also famous as the one who is capable of winning difficult
            situations. This is the only Lingam in the world which faces south, the direction of Death.
            The Mahakaleshwar temple is also one of the eighteen Maha Shakti Peethas. Shakti Peethas are the sites where
            body parts of Sati Devi fell after the Sudarshana Chakra, in the Daksha Yoga episode of Hindu mythology, cut
            her body. Devotees believe that the Upper Lip of the Sati Devi fell here. Moreover, the Goddess is popular
            as Mahakali here.
            History : Lord Brahma himself established the first temple at the site. The coins recovered at Ujjain have
            the mark of Lord Shiva on them. According to several poetic texts, in the Paramara period, invaders
            destroyed the temple. Later, Udayaditya and Naravarman, the rulers of the Malwa region, rebuilt it.
            According to the ancient scripture, Sthalapuranam, King Chandrasena was a devotee of Shiva. A young boy
            named Shrikhar heard his prayers to the god and wanted to join him. However, people did not let him do it
            and sent him out of the city. Shrikhar heard the plans of rival kings Ripudhamana and Singhaditya to attack
            the city with the help of the demon king Dushan.
            Asura Dushan had a blessing of invisibility from Brahma. So, Shrikhar and a priest named Vriddhi prayed to
            Lord Shiva for help. The enemies arrived at Avantika (now known as Ujjain) and started torturing the people.
            They banned all Vedic Dharmanushtan activities in the city. The people started praying to Lord Shiva for
            ––help.
            Devotees also believe that when Dushan started attacking Avantika, the ground split near the statue of
            Godess Parvati and Lord Shiva came out of it as Mahakaal. He burnt the demons with just one grunt. Adhering
            to the request of the people of Avantika, Lord Shiva then decided to stay there as the chief deity of
            Avantika.
            The Mahakaleshwar temple is a three-storied structure. The Lingam of Mahakaleshwar is worshipped on the
            first floor, which is actually under the ground level. On the second level, the Lingam of Omkareshwara is
            worshipped. The Nagachandeshwara Linga is worshipped on the third level. The third level is open to the
            public only on Naag Panchmi
