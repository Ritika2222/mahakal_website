                10. Final Statement</b>

            <br>
            <b> 1.The information collected by Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee Ujjain</b>

            We will not knowingly use information collected on this website to others in ways different from what is
            disclosed in this statement. Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee collects information from our
            users at several different points on our website. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, "Personally
            Identifiable Information" refers to information that can directly identify an individual; for example, such
            information may include an individual's name, photograph, ID cards, mailing address, phone number or email
            address.
            <br>
            1.1 Information that Is Automatically Collected:We use IP addresses, to analyze identity of booking area,
            track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not
            linked to Personally Identifiable Information.
            <br>
            1.2 Information that Is Actively Submitted to Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee, Ujjain:A user
            must provide contact information (such as name and email address) so that we can stay in touch with our
            users. This information is also used to fulfill booking, order and registration requests. To donate online
            or for other service ordered, a user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address)
            and financial information (such as a credit card number and its expiration date). This information is used
            for billing purposes, with the help of our service provider (the bank which is providing us the payment
            gateway facilities), and to fill users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact
            information is used to get in touch with the user.
            <br>
            1.3 Third Party Advertisers on Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee's, Ujjain Website:Presently,
            we do not provide any third party advertisement on our website. No third party interference is yet allowed
            and hence there is no question of collecting any information from third party from our website.
            <br>
            1.4 Information Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee, Ujjain Obtains from Third Parties:Presently
            website is not collecting user information from third party. Only in case of Payment Gateway, the bank (who
            so ever provides the payment gateway services for online transaction) collects very critical information
            like Credit card or debit card number, Expiry date of credit card or debit card , Credit card or debit card
            holders name, amount deducted from their credit or debit account and any other relevant information which is
            must for online transaction. These information are collected by payment gateway service provider and these
            information along with your contact information are stored with payment gateway service provider.
            <br>
            The critical information like credit or debit card number, its expiry date, card holderâ€™s name, bank name
            are not at all stored, infact it is stored with the payment gateway services providers. The payment gateway
            service provider sends the transaction number to Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee website on
            completion of payment procedure along with status of transaction (like success, cancel or error). As Shri
            Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee is not at all collecting credit or debit card details there is no
            question of storing it to the server of NIC, Trust and using it for any purpose. These critical information
            is solely stored with payment gateway service provider. They also never use your card details with any third
            party except the bank from where they need to deduct sanctioned amount by you.
            <br>
            a. On Successful transaction of payment:In case of successful transaction of payment for donation, services
            or product the user will inform accordingly. The details will also informed via email (if proper email
            address provided at the time of payment). The amount will be deducted from user's respective bank and
            credited in the account of Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee account. The user will get
            necessary entry in their passbook or bank statement directly from their bank. If payment is for donation,
            user will get income tax exemption certificate (in India only). The certificate will be provided in the form
            of donation slip (online) and user has to get it printed. If user want it physical receipt then it will be
            delivered to his contact address within two months from the date of payment online. The exemption from
            income tax is only granted in case of donation made to Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Management Committee and is
            not refundable on any condition. However, payment of services or for purchase of products like prasad or
            services etc is not exempted from income tax.
            <br>
            b. On Cancel of transaction of payment:If user cancels the transaction in middle of the process, the details
            are stored in the database and transaction of record generated mentioning that user has interfered in middle
            of transaction and cancels the transaction. In case of cancellation of transaction, it is possible that
            server might have already completed transaction and user may get the report of transaction late. In that
            case: If transaction is for donation cancel of order is not possible If transition is for services or
            purchase of product than user has to enter cancellation of order procedure. This is possible by user to
            enter in their account by userid and password and selecting the order which is required to be cancelled If
            order is already processed (for example book is already sent or services are already enjoyed ) then
            cancellation is not possible.
