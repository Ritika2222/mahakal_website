            <h2>Shree Chintaman ganesh</h2>
            <p>Chintamani Ganesh Temple is said to be one of the most ancient temples of Ujjain, it is also one of the
                most visited places in Ujjain Madhya Pradesh. Chintamani in Hindi means Lord Vishnu; it is the other
                name for Vishnu. So, the temple that has the idol of Lord Ganesha and Lord Vishnu together, is known as
                the Chintamani Temple.
                The temple's idol is believed to be self-manifested. The deity is known as Chintaharan/Cintaman Ganesha-
                the one who gives an assurance of freedom from worldly anxieties, the reliever of all tensions. The
                consorts of Lord Ganesha, Riddhi and Siddhi, are placed here on both sides of the lord. The entire
                temple is built wholly of stone and in the assembly hall are beautifully carved pillars that date back
                to the Paramara period (9th to 14th century).

                <br /> <br />
                Chintaman ganesh is the biggest temple of lord ganesh in ujjain

            <h2>Kaalbhairav</h2>
            <p>At a distance of 7 km from Ujjain Junction, Kal Bhairav Temple is a revered Hindu shrine located in
                Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. Situated on the banks of the Kshipra River, it is one of the most active temples
                in Ujjain,
                The Kal Bhairav Temple is dedicated to Kal Bhairav, a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva, and he is
                regarded as the guardian deity of the city. Though Ujjain houses a huge number of temples within its
                geographical area, Kal Bhairav is the most prominent one and records a footfall of thousands of devotees
                every day. The worship of Ashta Bhairava is a part of the Saivite tradition, and the Kal Bhairav is
                considered their chief. The worship of Kal Bhairav was traditionally popular among the Kapalika and
                Aghora sects, and Ujjain was a prominent center of these sects.
                According to the Avanti Khanda of the Skanda Purana, the original temple of Lord Kal Bhairav is believed
                to have been built by an obscure king named Bhadrasen. Images of Lord Shiva, Parvati, Lord Vishnu, and
                Ganesha belonging to the Paramara period (9th-13th century CE) have been recovered from the place. The
                present-day temple that shows Maratha's influence, was built over the remains of the older temple.
                According to history, after the defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761 CE), the Maratha general
                Mahadaji Shinde offered his pagri (turban) to the deity, praying for victory in his campaign to restore
                the Maratha rule in North India. After successfully resurrecting Maratha's power, he restored the
                temple.

            <h2>Harasiddhi</h2>
            <p>At a distance of 2.5 km from Ujjain Junction, Harsiddhi Temple is a sacred Hindu temple located in
                Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. Situated near Mahakal Temple, it is one of the most sacred temples in India
                Dedicated goddess Parvati, Harsiddhi Temple is one of the 51 Shaktipeeths of Mata Sati. This temple
                occupies a special place in the galaxy of ancient sacred spots of Ujjain. Seated between the idols of
                Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati, the idol of Annapurna is painted in dark vermilion color. The Sri Yantra,
                the symbol of power or shakti, is also enshrined in the temple.According to the Shiva Purana, when Shiva
                carried away the burning body of Sati from the sacrificial fire, her elbow dropped at this place. There
                is an interesting legend in the Skanda Purana about the manner in which the Goddess Chandi acquired the
                epithet of Harsiddhi. Once when Shiva and Parvati were alone on Mount Kailash, two demons Chand and
                Prachand tried to force their way in.Shiva called upon Chandi to destroy them which she did. Pleased,
                Shiva bestowed upon her the epithet of ‘one who vanquishes all’.
                The temple architecture has some Maratha influences. It has four entrances, one in each direction, and
                the main entrance is on the eastern side. The Sri Yantra, the symbol of power or shakti, is also
                enshrined in the temple. The two pillars adorned with lamps here are special features of Maratha art.
                These lamps lit during Navaratri, present a glorious spectacle. There is an ancient well on the
                premises, and an artistic pillar adorns the top of it..

            <h2>Vedshala</h2>
            <p>The architectural marvel Jantar Mantar (also called the Vedh Shala Observatory), established in the 17th
                century is the oldest to be constructed among the group of five observatories ( Jaipur, Delhi, Ujjain,
                Mathura, and Varanasi). There are many significant places in Ujjain and Vedhshala is one of them. It is
                the first observatory of India. Constructed by Sawai Raja Jai Singh between 1719-30 when he was in
                Ujjain as the Governor of Malwa , the Vedhshala is a must visit place in Ujjain. A number of
                astronomical studies and predictions were done here in the remote past. Such was the efficiency of the
                instruments and the techniques that even the planetary motions were also studied at a time when science
                and technology was in a state of infancy, not only in India but also in the whole world. However in due
                course of time this observatory faded and lost much of its glory, when it was renovated back to its
                earlier form in the year 1923 by Madhav Rao Scindhia the then Maharaja of Gwalior.
                Shanku Yatra: This is an extraordinary instrument devised by Raja Jay Singh, which is capable of
                predicting the shortest and the longest day of the year. Along with these it can also predict the two
                days (21st March and 23rd September) in a year when the day and night are of equal length. With the help
                of mid-day shadow, we can also determine the altitude of Ujjain city. The seven lines drawn on it
                indicates the 12 zodiac signs.
                Samarata Yantra: This yantra is mainly used to determine the declination of any celestial body towards
                the north or south.

                Nadivalaya Yantra: On the south side of the Samarat yantra is the Nadi valaya yantra which consists of a
                circular dial. Over the centuries this instrument has been accurately helping astronomers to get an idea
                of planetary positions and also the exact time of the Ujjain city.

                Sun dial: Constructed in such a way that the upper planes of the two walls on the sides of the steps of
                the sun dial are parallel to the axis of the earth. The local time of Ujjain can be very well predicted
                by using this device.

                Diganash Yantra: This instrument is applicable in fixing out the Altitude (distance from the horizon)
                and the Azimuth (angular distance from the east or the west point measured along the horizon) of any
                celestial body.

                Transit Yantra : This instrument built in the plane of the meridian circle (i.e. the circle joining the
                south-north and the zenith point) is used for observing the zenith distance of any celestial body
                (corresponding to its mid-day).

            <h2>Sandipani Asrama</h2>
            <p>Ancient Ujjain, apart from its political and religious importance, was a prestigious center of learning
                at the beginning of the Mahabharata period. . Maharishi Sandipani’s ashram is situated at Mangalnath
                road foot.The area near the ashram is known as Ankpat, a place believed to have been used by Lord
                Krishna to wash his writings.
                Sandipani Ashram is a holy shrine which is built in remembrance of the Maharishi Sandipani and is
                considered one of the famous tourist spots in Ujjain. According to mythology, it is believed that this
                is the ashram where Guru Sandipani used to teach Shri Krishna, his friend Sudama and Lord Krishna's
                brother Balram. Ashram now looks more like a temple and three idols of Krishna, Balram and Sudama are
                present along with that of Guru Sandipani. There is also a stone where numerals 1 to 100 found engraved
                and is believed to be done by guru Sandipani himself.
                The ashram complex is huge and with vast stretches of land. There are a lot of shrines but obviously,
                the main shrine belongs to Guru Sandipani. One of the temples situated here, called Sarveshwar Mahadev,
                the temple here is the only temple in India to have a standing statue of Nandi - the sacred bull houses
                a 6000-year Shivlinga with Shesnaag is in its natural form, and is believed to be worshipped by Guru
                Sandipani and his disciples. Ashram also has a huge stepped tank called Gomati Kund, in which Lord
                Krishna summoned all the holy water from the holy centers so that Guru Sandipani finds it easier to get
                the holy water. The water of this pond is believed to be sacred and so, devotees fill their water
                bottles here and take the water home.

                The Gomti Kund is the tank which provided water to the ashram, and on its bank are two Shiva Lingams,
                with footprints in between them, believed to be those of Krishna.

            <h2>Managalnath</h2>
            <p>Mangalnath is a renowned Hindu temple located on the coast of the Shipra River. The Mangalnath Mandir is
                devoted to Lord Shiva the protector and king of Ujjain Nagari. The temple has a very nice atmosphere and
                is famous for Bhaat Puja. This is the only temple dedicated to Shree Mangalnath. Thousands of people
                visit the temple to resolve their problems.
                According to the matsya purana, a powerful demon Andhakasura performed austerity, impressed by his
                austerity Lord Shiva gave him a boon that whenever a drop of blood would fall from his body on the
                ground, a new Andhakasura would be produced. After getting the boon, Andhakasura started misusing his
                powers by creating havoc on the earth. Troubled by his actions, all the gods went to Lord Shiva and
                prayed to him to save them from Andhakasura. A war took place between Lord and Andhakasura. During the
                war, a drop of sweat fell from Lord Shiva’s body on the ground resulting in the birth of Lord Mangal.
                Lord Mangal absorbed all the blood generated from the demon’s body. After the war, all the gods
                established a shivling at that place and named it Mangalnath.
                It is believed that Mangalnath Mandir is the center of the earth. The Tropic of Cancer passes through
                Mangalnath Temple. According to astrologers, if a person has mars in the first, fourth, seventh, eighth,
                and twelfth position in a horoscope then the person is suffering from mangal dosha. Mangalnath is the
                only Manglik temple that can convert all the bad qualities of a Manglik into virtuous ones.
