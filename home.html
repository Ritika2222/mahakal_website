                    Jyotirlingas means (column or pillar of light). The ‘stambha’ symbol represent that there is no
                    beginning or end.
                    When Lord BRAHMA and Lord VISHNU had an argument about who was the supreme god, Lord SHIV appeared
                    as a column of loight and asked each one to find the ends. Neither could do it. It is belived that
                    the place where these columns of light fell is where the jyotirlingas are located.
                    Of which 12 jyotirlingas in India, the MAHAKALESHWSR jyotirlinga is believed to be swayambhu i.e.
                    originated on it’s own. Since kaal means ‘Time’ and ‘Death’

                    linga, so it’s derives power on it’s own. It does not require mantra Shakti for power like the other
                    lingas and statues. It is only jyotirlinga that faces south –‘dakshinmukhi’. All the other
                    jyotirlingas faces east. This is beause the direction of death is delived to be south. As Lord Shiva
                    faces south, it symbolizes that he is master of death. In fact, people worship Mahakaleshwar to
                    prevent untimely death- to enjoy a long life

        <p><b>BHASMA AARTI:-</b> <br>BHASMA AARTI OF Mahakal is one of the main attraction at Mnhakalesar temple in Ujjain. This
            uniqe ritual begian every day at 4am. People from all walks of life Ujjain with a desire of beholding this
            lifetime experience. The eary morning peaceful and calm environment at the temple is wht fills you with
            immense positivity.
            In the past, Mahakal Bhasm aarrti was performed with ash from the first funeral pyre cremated at night. But
            with the changing times, the practice has changed and fresh ash is prepared from cow dung. Since no one is
            allowed to enter the Garbhagriha, the devotes can witness the enter process through a screen projection
            installed inside the temple.
            The process begins with the ‘Adhishek’ or the ritual bath of the shiviling then smearing it with multiple
            offerings like curd, honey, sandal paste finally cleaning it with milk and water. Further, the shivling is
            decorated with elaborate arrangments of the fowers and espically the Bel leaves that are considered to be
            very dear to Lord Shiv are also offered. The process however dosen’t end here. There is more to witness even
            before the ash ritual is performed. Through the application of various substances, the shivlinga is
            transformed into a divine face and then further embellished with garland.
            After this hour-long process of bathing and decoration the idol come the most – awaited and interesting part
            associated with this first aarti of the day. The entire shivlinga is veiled with a cloth in a manner that
            the decoration is not distributed. Thereafter, the head priest swings the ash-filled pouch on the shivling.
            The entire sanctum is filled in the grey dust. This process of sprinkling ash on the shivling last a minute.
            This is followed by performing Aarti with lit oil lamps, the clangingof bells, and the chants of ‘Om Namah
            Shivay’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’. When you are able to witness this entire process and the aarti starts, you
            just feel that have experienced one of the most beautiful things in life.
